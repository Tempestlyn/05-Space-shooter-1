# 05-Space-shooter
 A 2D space shooter game 
I used the project template and the setup from the collision assignment to begin. It was confusing to extract a sprite from spritesheets so I searched for .png format . I understood how to make enemies shoot with some help from Youtube. Applied a loop for that. Changed background color. The open_color module was not accesible by the interpreter for some reason so I used the import color and changed everything to colo.(color name but in CAPS).
I have a gamer over message at the end too.
