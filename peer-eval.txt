Project: Space Shooter
Peer's repository:  https://github.com/dbhadour/05-Space-Shooter.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
How to have enemy sprites fire weapons at random intervals. I've been trying to figure that out for a while now.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
As I said before, a method of random initialization that can be used for shooting, spawning, etc
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

 Nothing much, it's well organized and not spaced out like I tend to do it.

What could have been clearer or better commented?

Could have added several comments within the "update" function. There's alot of functionality that goes unexplained.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 No

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

Yes 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

Nope, pretty much explained their whole process. 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

Thanks for finding a solution to something I have been trying to find out myself.
